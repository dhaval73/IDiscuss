## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Download and install XAMPP on your computer from [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

2. Start XAMPP and ensure that the Apache and MySQL modules are running. You can do this by launching the XAMPP Control Panel and starting the required modules.

3. Clone your PHP project repository to the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation. You can do this by opening the XAMPP installation folder, navigating to the `htdocs` directory, and using the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhaval73/IDiscuss.git

### ImportDatabase

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin (make sure XAMPP is running).

2. If you haven't already, create a new database for your forum. To do this:
   - Click on the "Databases" tab in phpMyAdmin.
   - Enter a name for your new database in the "Create database" field.
   - Choose the desired collation (e.g., utf8_general_ci) from the dropdown menu.
   - Click the "Create" button to create the new database.

3. Select the newly created database from the list on the left-hand side.

4. Choose the "Import" tab in the top navigation menu.

5. Click the "Choose File" button and navigate to the location of the `idiscuss.sql` file from your project's directory.

6. Once you've selected the `idiscuss.sql` file, click the "Go" button to start the import process.

7. phpMyAdmin will now execute the SQL queries in the `idiscuss.sql` file and populate your database with the necessary tables and data.

8. You should see a success message indicating that the import was completed.


## RunningYourForum

1. With XAMPP running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/IDiscuss (replace `IDiscuss` with the actual folder name of your project in the `htdocs` directory).

2. You should now be able to access your PHP forum project and start exploring the features.
